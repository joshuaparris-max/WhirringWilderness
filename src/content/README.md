# Content

Data files for game content. This folder contains static data definitions for locations, creatures, items, quests, and dialogue.

Examples of what goes here:
- Location definitions (forests, caves, towns)
- Creature/NPC data
- Item definitions
- Quest structures
- Dialogue trees
- World state data

These are typically TypeScript/JSON files that define the game's content structure.
