# Types

Shared TypeScript type definitions. This folder contains type definitions that are used across multiple parts of the application.

Examples of what goes here:
- Game state types
- Entity types (Player, NPC, Item, etc.)
- Location types
- Quest types
- Event types
- Utility types

These types ensure type safety and consistency across the codebase.
