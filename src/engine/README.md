# Engine

Pure TypeScript game logic. This folder contains the core game systems and mechanics.

**Important:** This folder should NOT import any React code. It should be framework-agnostic and contain only pure game logic.

Examples of what goes here:
- Game state management
- Combat systems
- Inventory management
- Quest tracking
- Location navigation
- Character stats and progression
