# Platform

Storage and configuration helpers. This folder contains utilities for platform-specific functionality like local storage, configuration management, and other system-level operations.

Examples of what goes here:
- StorageManager.ts (localStorage/sessionStorage wrappers)
- ConfigManager.ts (game settings and preferences)
- Save/Load utilities
- Platform detection
- Browser compatibility helpers

These utilities provide a clean interface for platform-specific operations.
