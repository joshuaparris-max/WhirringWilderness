# UI

React components for the user interface. This folder contains all the visual components that render the game to the user.

Examples of what goes here:
- App.tsx (main application component)
- GameScreen.tsx (main game view)
- InventoryUI.tsx
- DialogueUI.tsx
- LocationUI.tsx
- CharacterSheet.tsx
- Menu components

These components interact with the engine layer to display game state and handle user input.
